                <h3>An adventure unlike any other</h3>
                <p>In this edition of the Exchange Program, that will happen between <strong>December of 2019 and March of 2020</strong>, you will have two options to build a stronger Global Network:</p> 
                <p>You can <strong>travel</strong> to another country where you'll be hosted for up to 3 weeks by a local junior entrepreneur and their JE. You'll work part-time for your host JE, living their routine, learning about their network and contributing with your skills and knowledges.</p>
                <p>Or...</p>
                <p>You can <strong>host</strong> a junior enterpreneur from anywhere in the World that will bring a new culture, new ideas, experiences and knowledge from their own country, network and JE.</p>
                <p>And in both cases, you'll also be challenged to go beyond.</p>
                <p>You will share purpose, stories & moments. You will have an incredible intercultural experience. And you'll discover everything about another network, different from yours but for sure with several good practices to be shared.</p>

              <p>We will try to match travelers and hosts in a way that we achieve the biggest impact. Travelers may indicate preference for a specific language or country, but we cannot guarantee fulfillment of these preferences.</p>
              <p>Once we have a match possibility, the host meets the possible travelers via videoconference and, if everything goes well with the dates selected and both have similar goals with the program, we proceed with the match. Then, to confirm the exchange, both sides will sign a Commitment Term and the traveler will have to pay a <strong>€100 participation fee</strong>. After this, the JEGlobal Team will provide all the aid that both sides need: travel tips, planning of the Exchange schedule, legal processes to travel and so on.</p>
              <p>This fee helps support the Enlargement, Connection and Support to Confederations work of <a href="https://juniorenterprises.org/">Junior Enterprises Global</a> around the world and is what we charge for our work organizing the program.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, for a more challenging experience, pick the regions that are most different from your own!</p>

                    <p>Having the privilege of working with LisbonPH members has been the highlight of my time in Portugal. I can't say nothing except thank them for the good times and sweet memories that we shared together. Not only have I enjoyed working with them, but I have also gained a lot of experience and now I know how a well-functioning JE should be run. My journey with LisbonPH has prepared me for the next steps.</p>

                    <p>The exchange about the similarities and differences of the two student consultancies, Janus and TECMEC, was of great benefit. The characteristics of a German JE could be shown and improved with the help of Brazilian methods. But also Karol got great ideas for the work of her JE!</p>

                    <p>During our stay, we got to discover the way they work in the JE and more importantly got to discuss the differences between our practices  and how our young JE could learn from its Brazilian peers in order to be more efficient and increase its productivity. Our short but intense week in São Paulo made us rething the way we do things back in Morocco and pushed us to start a restructuration of our activities.</p>

                    <p>The experience offers the possibility of growth in the JE, you learn new ways of management and values from other countries. It is always a joy to receive an exchanger because they bring with them a lot of energy and motivation that transmits the feeling of being part of a larger and stronger movement, this motivates you to do more</p>
