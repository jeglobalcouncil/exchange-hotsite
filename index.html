                <h3>An adventure unlike any other</h3>
                <p>In the Exchange Program, you will travel to another country between <strong>January and March of 2019</strong>, where you'll be hosted for up to 3 weeks by a local junior entrepreneur and their JE.</p>
                <p>During these weeks, you'll work part-time for your host JE, living their routine and contributing with your skills.</p>
                <p>But you will also be challenged to do much more than that.</p>
                <p>You will share purpose, stories & moments together with your hosts. You will leave your mark in another JE, in another network. And you'll meet several other JEs plus the best that each of them have to offer.</p>
